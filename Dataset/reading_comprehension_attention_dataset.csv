0,"In geometry, an object has symmetry if there is an operation or transformation (such as translation, scaling, rotation or reflection) that maps the figure/object onto itself (i.e., the object has an invariance under the transform). Thus, a symmetry can be thought of as an immunity to change. For instance, a circle rotated about its center will have the same shape and size as the original circle, as all points before and after the transform would be indistinguishable",What is symmetry in geometry?,"[1.0, 1.0, 0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0, 0.75, 0.75, 1.0, 0.75, 1.0, 0.75, 0.75, 0.75, 0.75, 0.75, 0.5, 0.75, 0, 1.0, 0.75, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0, 0.75, 1.0, 1.0, 0.75, 1.0, 1.0, 0.75, 1.0, 0, 0, 1.0, 0, 0, 0.5, 0.5, 0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0, 0, 0, 0.75, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.75, 0, 0.75, 0.75, 0.75, 0.75, 0.5, 0.75, 0, 0, 0.75, 0.75, 0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.75, 0.5, 0.75, 0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0]","[1.0, 0.25, 1.0, 0.5, 0.75]"
